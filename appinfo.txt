This Python application is designed to predict future stock market prices using historical data. 

It's a basic example of how machine learning, specifically linear regression, can be applied to financial datasets. 

The script, intended primarily for educational and demonstration purposes, illustrates the fundamental steps of data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

 It processes data with Pandas, trains a model with scikit-learn, and evaluates predictions.

The project includes a requirements.txt for easy library installation.
